# Usage:
#   python bioagents/training/grpo_trainer.py --config configs/grpo_psychiatry.yaml
#   accelerate launch --config_file configs/accelerate_ds_zero2.yaml \
#       bioagents/training/grpo_trainer.py --config configs/grpo_psychiatry.yaml

# Domain: Psychiatry
# Description: GRPO training for psychiatry and mental health tasks with
#              critical safety monitoring for suicide risk assessment and
#              patient safety. Lower temperature for more conservative responses.

meta:
  experiment: "GRPO Psychiatry with Enhanced Safety"
  description: >
    GRPO training on Psychiatry domain with composite reward
    (accuracy 0.3 + format 0.15 + process 0.3 + safety 0.25).
    Critical safety monitoring (0.25 weight) for suicide risk assessment
    and patient safety. Lower temperature (0.5) for more conservative,
    safety-focused responses. Uses Qwen3-1.7B base with LoRA (r=16).

# Usage:
#   python bioagents/training/grpo_trainer.py --config configs/grpo_obstetrics.yaml
#   accelerate launch --config_file configs/accelerate_ds_zero2.yaml \
#       bioagents/training/grpo_trainer.py --config configs/grpo_obstetrics.yaml

# Domain: Obstetrics
# Description: GRPO training for obstetrics and maternal-fetal health tasks.
#              Enhanced safety monitoring for both maternal and fetal safety.
#              Lower temperature for conservative, safety-focused responses.

meta:
  experiment: "GRPO Obstetrics with Maternal-Fetal Safety"
  description: >
    GRPO training on Obstetrics domain with composite reward
    (accuracy 0.35 + format 0.15 + process 0.3 + safety 0.2).
    Enhanced safety monitoring (0.2 weight) for both maternal and fetal safety.
    Lower temperature (0.5) for conservative, safety-focused responses.
    Uses Qwen3-1.7B base with LoRA (r=16).

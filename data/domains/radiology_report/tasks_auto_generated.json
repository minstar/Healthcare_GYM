It is important to recognize that the importance of model interpretation is task dependent, and different levels of model interpretation are necessary for different tasks. Table 1 organizes the reviewed literature by interpretation technique and image analysis task. The implementation of model interpretation techniques is common in detection and classification tasks, but not in segmentation tasks, despite segmentation being a large application of deep learning in medical imaging. This disparity may be attributed to the difference in perceived importance of interpretation by task. For detection and classification, it is natural to want to compare the parts of an image the model uses to make a prediction to the parts of an image a physician would use. In",

Telemedicine: Implementing telemedicine technology can enable remote radiologists to review and interpret imaging studies in real-time. By establishing a secure network connection, the images can be transmitted instantly to the radiologist, reducing the time taken for interpretation. This would allow for prompt diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment.\n\n2. Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS): Installing a PACS system in the rural health clinic would facilitate the storage, retrieval, and sharing of medical images. Instead of physically sending the images to the city hospital, the digital images can be securely uploaded to the system, enabling remote access by radiologists. This eliminates the need for physical transportation and significantly reduces the turnaround time.\n\n3. Teleradiology Services: Engaging teleradiology services can provide immediate access to a pool of off-site radiologists who can interpret the imaging studies remotely. These services are available 24/7, ensuring round-the-clock coverage for image interpretation and minimizing delays in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n4.

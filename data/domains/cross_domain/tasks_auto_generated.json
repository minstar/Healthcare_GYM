    "correct_answer": "Evolving knowledge graph similarity for supervised learning in complex biomedical domains. BACKGROUND: In recent years, biomedical ontologies have become important for describing existing biological knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs. Data mining approaches that work with knowledge graphs have been proposed, but they are based on vector representations that do not capture the full underlying semantics. An alternative is to use machine learning approaches that explore semantic similarity. However, since ontologies can model multiple perspectives, semantic similarity computations for a given learning task need to be fine-tuned to account for this. Obtaining the best combination of semantic similarity aspects for each learning task is not trivial and typically depends on expert knowledge. RESULTS: We have developed a novel approach, evoKGsim, that applies Genetic Programming over a set",

Solving clinical problems involves the ability to reason about causality of pathological processes, requiring knowledge of anatomy and the working and pathology of organ systems, and it requires the ability to compare patient problems as patterns with instances of illness scripts of patients the clinician has seen in the past and stored in memory. The purpose of the book, supporting the teaching of clinical reasoning before students enter the clinical arena, faces the paradoxical problem of the lack of clinical experience that is so essential for building proficiency in clinical reasoning. So where to start if students are to be best prepared for first clinical encounters?",

Patients with stable chronic liver disease have several offsetting acidifying and alkalinising metabolic acid-base disorders.

Several important cases are presented or reviewed in which physical evidence indicates the existence of ionized base pairs. When thermodynamic values determined in aqueous solution under physiological conditions are considered, it can be argued that base ionization will contribute substantially to the stability of many biologically relevant base pairs containing modified bases. A significant incidence of ionized bases in DNA may have important kinetic ramifications for the further chemical reactivity of both the modified base and its cross-strand pairing partner.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions regarding the care of individual patients. This concept has gained popularity recently, and its applications have been steadily expanding. Nowadays, the term \"evidence-based\" is used in numerous situations and conditions, such as evidence-based medicine, evidence-based practice, evidence-based health care, evidence-based social work, evidence-based policy, and evidence-based education. However, many anesthesiologists and their colleagues have not previously been accustomed to utilizing EBM, and they have experienced difficulty in understanding and applying the techniques of EBM to their practice. In this article, the author discusses the brief history, definition, methods, and limitations of EBM. As EBM also involves making use of the best available information to",

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions regarding the care of individual patients. This concept has gained popularity recently, and its applications have been steadily expanding. Nowadays, the term \"evidence-based\" is used in numerous situations and conditions, such as evidence-based medicine, evidence-based practice, evidence-based health care, evidence-based social work, evidence-based policy, and evidence-based education. However, many anesthesiologists and their colleagues have not previously been accustomed to utilizing EBM, and they have experienced difficulty in understanding and applying the techniques of EBM to their practice.

    "correct_answer": "Base-Pairing and Base-Stacking Contributions to Double-Stranded DNA Formation. Double-stranded (ds)DNA formation and dissociation are of fundamental biological importance. The negative DNA charge influences the dsDNA stability. However, the base pairing and the stacking between neighboring bases are responsible for the sequence-dependent stability of dsDNA. The stability of a dsDNA molecule can be estimated from empirical nearest-neighbor models based on contributions assigned to base-pair steps along the DNA and additional parameters because of DNA termini. In efforts to separate contributions, it has been concluded that base stacking dominates dsDNA stability, whereas base pairing contributes negligibly. Using a different model for dsDNA formation, we reanalyze dsDNA stability contributions and conclude that base stacking contributes already at the level of separate ssDNAs but that pairing contributions drive the dsDNA formation.

Physicians who specialize in medical laboratory pathology are called Pathologists. Any abnormal process can be termed to be pathologic. Some examples of the application of the term are listed. # Health Pathologies - Anatomic pathology refers to the study of abnormal structures in medicine. The term encompasses gross (visible to the naked eye), microscopic (cellular), and molecular structural abnormalities.

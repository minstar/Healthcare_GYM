She is accompanied by her husband who notes that she has had at least three similar episodes that have occurred over the past two years. He also notes that she has been “more emotional” lately and seems confused throughout the day. She has had to leave her job as a librarian at her child’s elementary school. Her past medical history is notable for two diagnostic laparoscopies for recurrent episodes of abdominal pain of unknown etiology. Her family history is notable for psychosis in her mother and maternal grandfather. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 125/75 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is disheveled and appears confused and disoriented. Her attention span is limited and she exhibits emotional lability. This patient’s condition is most likely due to a defect in an enzyme that metabolizes which of the following compounds?\nOption A: Aminolevulinic acid\nOption B: Coproporphyrinogen III\nOption C: Hydroxymethylbilane\nOption D: Porphobilinogen",

Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?\nOption A: Random assortment\nOption B: Random nucleotide addition\nOption C: VDJ recombination\nOption D: Isotype switching\n",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL). STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 complicated by a history of prior SPTB. Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. RESULTS:",

PURPOSES: (1) To estimate physician perceived utility of physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. (2) To promote teaching of core physical examination competencies in student and resident education. METHODS: Primary care physicians at 2 academic medical centers were surveyed. Using a 5-category frequency scale, physicians estimated how often they perform and document 90 common physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 56%. Physicians reported significant variation in frequency of use for individual physical examination maneuvers. Both common (blood pressure) and rarely performed (visual acuity)",

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults.

The authors review the current forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the current recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults, and provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.",

    "correct_answer": "A differential diagnosis refers to the process of identifying the possible diseases or conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms. It is an essential aspect of clinical practice as it helps healthcare professionals narrow down the potential causes and arrive at an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Gathering Information: The first step in creating a differential diagnosis involves collecting information about the patient's medical history, conducting a physical examination, and reviewing any relevant diagnostic tests.\n\n2. Generating a List: Based on this initial assessment, the healthcare professional creates a list of all potential diagnoses that could explain the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. Evaluating Possibilities: Each potential diagnosis on the list is then evaluated by considering the consistency of symptoms, risk factors, and how well it fits with the patient's medical history and examination findings.\n\n4. Ordering Diagnostic Tests: If necessary, additional diagnostic tests may be ordered to gather more information and help rule out certain possibilities.\n\n5. Refining the Diagnosis: As new information becomes available from test results, certain diagnoses can be eliminated or confirmed, allowing for further refinement of the differential diagnosis.\n\n6. Arriving at a Definitive Diagnosis: Eventually, the differential diagnosis will be narrowed down to one most likely diagnosis. This final diagnosis guides the appropriate treatment plan.\n\nThe importance of a differential diagnosis lies in its ability to promote patient safety and optimal care. It ensures that healthcare professionals consider various potential causes for a patient's symptoms before making a conclusive diagnosis. By exploring different possibilities and ruling out certain conditions, the differential diagnosis helps prevent",

PURPOSES: (1) To estimate physician perceived utility of physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. (2) To promote teaching of core physical examination competencies in student and resident education. METHODS: Primary care physicians at 2 academic medical centers were surveyed. Using a 5-category frequency scale, physicians estimated how often they perform and document 90 common physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 56%. Physicians reported significant variation in frequency of use for individual physical examination maneuvers.

    "correct_answer": "A differential diagnosis refers to the process of identifying the possible diseases or conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms. It is an essential aspect of clinical practice as it helps healthcare professionals narrow down the potential causes and arrive at an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Gathering Information: The first step in creating a differential diagnosis involves collecting information about the patient's medical history, conducting a physical examination, and reviewing any relevant diagnostic tests.\n\n2. Generating a List: Based on this initial assessment, the healthcare professional creates a list of all potential diagnoses that could explain the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. Evaluating Possibilities: Each potential diagnosis on the list is then evaluated by considering the consistency of symptoms, risk factors, and how well it fits with the patient's medical history and examination findings.\n\n4. Ordering Diagnostic Tests: If necessary, additional diagnostic tests may be ordered to gather more information and help rule out certain possibilities.\n\n5. Refining the Diagnosis: As new information becomes available from test results, certain diagnoses can be eliminated or confirmed, allowing for further refinement of the differential diagnosis.\n\n6. Arriving at a Definitive Diagnosis: Eventually, the differential diagnosis will be narrowed down to one most likely diagnosis. This final diagnosis guides the appropriate treatment plan.\n\nThe importance of a differential diagnosis lies in its ability to promote patient safety and optimal care. It ensures that healthcare professionals consider various potential causes for a patient's symptoms before making a conclusive diagnosis.

His shortness of breath is mostly at night, and he is also concerned about bilateral leg swelling. He is a heart failure patient who is being managed with oral medication and has been compliant with his drugs. Physical examination reveals an elderly man in respiratory distress with abdominal distention and bilateral pitting ankle edema. Respiratory rate is 32/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard on both lung bases. Pulse rate is 73/min and barely palpable. His blood pressure is 79/54 mm Hg. On auscultation, a blowing holosystolic murmur is heard at the apex radiating to the left axilla. An echocardiography shows an ejection fraction of 18%. The physician decides to include an inotropic agent in his current medication. What would likely result from this intervention?\nOption A: A decrease in the systemic vascular resistance\nOption B: A decrease in the interval between the heart sounds S1 and S2\nOption C: An increase in the left ventricular end-systolic volume\nOption D: A decrease in the interval between the heart sounds S2 and S1",

    "correct_answer": "A differential diagnosis refers to the process of identifying the possible diseases or conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms. It is an essential aspect of clinical practice as it helps healthcare professionals narrow down the potential causes and arrive at an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Gathering Information: The first step in creating a differential diagnosis involves collecting information about the patient's medical history, conducting a physical examination, and reviewing any relevant diagnostic tests.\n\n2. Generating a List: Based on this initial assessment, the healthcare professional creates a list of all potential diagnoses that could explain the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. Evaluating Possibilities: Each potential diagnosis on the list is then evaluated by considering the consistency of symptoms, risk factors, and how well it fits with the patient's medical history and examination findings.\n\n4. Ordering Diagnostic Tests: If necessary, additional diagnostic tests may be ordered to gather more information and help rule out certain possibilities.\n\n5. Refining the Diagnosis: As new information becomes available from test results, certain diagnoses can be eliminated or confirmed, allowing for further refinement of the differential diagnosis.\n\n6. Arriving at a Definitive Diagnosis: Eventually, the differential diagnosis will be narrowed down to one most likely diagnosis. This final diagnosis guides the appropriate treatment plan.\n\nThe importance of a differential diagnosis lies in its ability to promote patient safety and optimal care. It ensures that healthcare professionals consider various potential causes for a patient's symptoms before making a conclusive diagnosis. By exploring different possibilities and ruling out certain conditions, the differential diagnosis helps prevent",

BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor frequently overlooked mainly due to the wide range of its clinical presentation, which may vary from entirely untypical signs and symptoms to life-threatening complications. METHODS: The present study aims to present a case series recently treated in our center, with emphasis placed on patients' specific characteristics, clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation. Relevant literature and current guidelines are being briefly reviewed to summarize screening for pheochromocytoma and appropriate diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: While the classic symptoms include headache, palpitations and sweating with permanent or paroxysmal hypertension, a wide range of clinical manifestations may be attributed to pheochromocytoma. The initial screening test is measurement of plasma or 24-hour urine metanephrine levels. Abdominal computerized",

    "correct_answer": "A differential diagnosis refers to the process of identifying the possible diseases or conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms. It is an essential aspect of clinical practice as it helps healthcare professionals narrow down the potential causes and arrive at an accurate diagnosis.\n\n1. Gathering Information: The first step in creating a differential diagnosis involves collecting information about the patient's medical history, conducting a physical examination, and reviewing any relevant diagnostic tests.\n\n2. Generating a List: Based on this initial assessment, the healthcare professional creates a list of all potential diagnoses that could explain the patient's symptoms.\n\n3. Evaluating Possibilities: Each potential diagnosis on the list is then evaluated by considering the consistency of symptoms, risk factors, and how well it fits with the patient's medical history and examination findings.\n\n4. Ordering Diagnostic Tests: If necessary, additional diagnostic tests may be ordered to gather more information and help rule out certain possibilities.\n\n5. Refining the Diagnosis: As new information becomes available from test results, certain diagnoses can be eliminated or confirmed, allowing for further refinement of the differential diagnosis.\n\n6. Arriving at a Definitive Diagnosis: Eventually, the differential diagnosis will be narrowed down to one most likely diagnosis. This final diagnosis guides the appropriate treatment plan.\n\nThe importance of a differential diagnosis lies in its ability to promote patient safety and optimal care. It ensures that healthcare professionals consider various potential causes for a patient's symptoms before making a conclusive diagnosis.

Viral etiologies of lower respiratory infection are less likely to cause sputum production, and if present, tends to be watery or scant. In contrast, sputum production tends to be mucopurulent when due to bacterial pneumonia. Clinical signs of viral respiratory illness include fever, rales (crackles) on auscultation, hypoxemia, and tachycardia.

However, there is debate on the utility of the physical examination, and students are deficient in many common maneuvers. PURPOSES: (1) To estimate physician perceived utility of physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. (2) To promote teaching of core physical examination competencies in student and resident education. METHODS: Primary care physicians at 2 academic medical centers were surveyed. Using a 5-category frequency scale, physicians estimated how often they perform and document 90 common physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 56%. Physicians reported significant variation in frequency of use for individual physical examination maneuvers. Both common (blood pressure) and rarely performed (visual acuity)",

BACKGROUND: History and physical examination are the basis of any diagnosis. The findings of the physical examination usually corroborate the thoughts generated by the medical history. However, it is not uncommon for the physician to note discrepancies between the history and the physical examination. METHODS: Two physicians provided a list of diseases they have encountered in which there is occasionally discordance between the data retrieved from the patient's medical history and the findings of the physical examination. To verify the data from knowledge and experience, we resorted to two main medical textbooks and relevant articles from PubMed. RESULTS: We identified 25 diseases where a discordance between history and physical examination may frequently be observed.",

The clinical presentation of viral pneumonia does not differentiate between the specific viral causes of respiratory infection. The common clinical presentation of acute viral respiratory infection includes cough, dyspnea, fever, and pleuritic chest pain. Viral etiologies of lower respiratory infection are less likely to cause sputum production, and if present, tends to be watery or scant. In contrast, sputum production tends to be mucopurulent when due to bacterial pneumonia. Clinical signs of viral respiratory illness include fever, rales (crackles) on auscultation, hypoxemia, and tachycardia. These four signs together have a positive predictive value of 57.1%, with fever as the strongest clinically predictive sign of a viral respiratory infection versus that of bacterial",

BACKGROUND: History and physical examination are the basis of any diagnosis. The findings of the physical examination usually corroborate the thoughts generated by the medical history. However, it is not uncommon for the physician to note discrepancies between the history and the physical examination. METHODS: Two physicians provided a list of diseases they have encountered in which there is occasionally discordance between the data retrieved from the patient's medical history and the findings of the physical examination. To verify the data from knowledge and experience, we resorted to two main medical textbooks and relevant articles from PubMed. RESULTS: We identified 25 diseases where a discordance between history and physical examination may frequently be observed.",

Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees.

RESULTS: While the classic symptoms include headache, palpitations and sweating with permanent or paroxysmal hypertension, a wide range of clinical manifestations may be attributed to pheochromocytoma. The initial screening test is measurement of plasma or 24-hour urine metanephrine levels. Abdominal computerized",

METHODS: The present study aims to present a case series recently treated in our center, with emphasis placed on patients' specific characteristics, clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation. Relevant literature and current guidelines are being briefly reviewed to summarize screening for pheochromocytoma and appropriate diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: While the classic symptoms include headache, palpitations and sweating with permanent or paroxysmal hypertension, a wide range of clinical manifestations may be attributed to pheochromocytoma. The initial screening test is measurement of plasma or 24-hour urine metanephrine levels. Abdominal computerized",

The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?\nOption A: Apical ballooning of the left ventricle\nOption B: Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins\nOption C: Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space\nOption D: Systemic bacterial infection\n",

When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child.

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults. Patient desire for extensive testing and comprehensive examination combined with provider belief that the physical examination is both of proven value and can detect subclinical illness have led to the continued pervasive practice of annual physical examinations in our country. The authors review the current forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the current recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults, and provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.",

However, there is debate on the utility of the physical examination, and students are deficient in many common maneuvers. PURPOSES: (1) To estimate physician perceived utility of physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. (2) To promote teaching of core physical examination competencies in student and resident education. METHODS: Primary care physicians at 2 academic medical centers were surveyed. Using a 5-category frequency scale, physicians estimated how often they perform and document 90 common physical examination maneuvers in a routine adult screening examination. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 56%. Physicians reported significant variation in frequency of use for individual physical examination maneuvers. Both common (blood pressure) and rarely performed (visual acuity)",

During the first month of his life, he had developed upper airway infections, bronchitis, and diarrhea. He has received all the immunizations according to his age. He failed to thrive since the age of 3 months. A month ago, he had a severe lung infection with cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea, and was unresponsive to an empiric oral macrolide. Upon admission to his local hospital, the patient has mild respiratory distress and crackles on auscultation. The temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), and the oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. The quantitative immunoglobulin tests show increased IgG, IgM, and IgA. The peripheral blood smear shows leukocytosis and normochromic normocytic anemia.

    "ticket": "QUESTION: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for follow-up of a chromosome analysis done 1 month ago. The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3. The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies. The parents are divorced, and the mother has custody of the child. The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town. The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\nOption A: Attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father\nOption B: Contact the father by telephone and arrange for him to give a blood sample at a local hospital\nOption C: Document your attempts to work with the mother but proceed no further, since you have no physician-patient relationship with the father\nOption D: Help the mother deal with her anger and educate her regarding the potential benefit to her son and others if the father's chromosome studies are done\nOption: ",

She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?\nOption A: Bilateral miosis\nOption B: Miosis of the right eye only\nOption C: Miosis of the left eye only\nOption D: Mydriasis of the left eye\n",

The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency.

BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor frequently overlooked mainly due to the wide range of its clinical presentation, which may vary from entirely untypical signs and symptoms to life-threatening complications. METHODS: The present study aims to present a case series recently treated in our center, with emphasis placed on patients' specific characteristics, clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation. Relevant literature and current guidelines are being briefly reviewed to summarize screening for pheochromocytoma and appropriate diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: While the classic symptoms include headache, palpitations and sweating with permanent or paroxysmal hypertension, a wide range of clinical manifestations may be attributed to pheochromocytoma. The initial screening test is measurement of plasma or 24-hour urine metanephrine levels. Abdominal computerized",

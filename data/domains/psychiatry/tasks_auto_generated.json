    "correct_answer": "Vitamin D and depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with depression and whether vitamin D supplementation is an effective treatment for depression. METHOD: Empirical papers published in recent years were identified using three search engines and online databases - PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database. Specific search terms used were 'vitamin D', 'depression' and 'treatment' and articles were selected that examined the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and depression, vitamin D supplementation and Vitamin D as a treatment for depression. Our review weighted more recent studies (from 2011), although also considered earlier publications. RESULTS: Empirical studies appear to provide increasing evidence for an association between vitamin D insufficiency and depression, and for vitamin D supplementation and augmentation in those with clinical depression",

Depression is a common condition that often remains undiagnosed and untreated; however, symptoms are more likely to be recognized today than in past decades. Survey data suggest that female, nonwhite patients are more likely to report depressive symptoms, especially those who are less educated, poor, and covered by Medicaid. Depression may be a finding suggestive of dysthymic disorder, minor or major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, episodic depression, or a sign of an associated mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder. Many effective treatments are available that are well tolerated. This article outlines the diagnostic approach used in primary care, as well as the different treatment options available for this condition.

Anxiety disorders are relatively common; almost 30% of the population suffer from some form of anxiety disorder at some point during their life. Anxiety and depressive symptoms often co-exist, and for physicians in primary care the boundaries between depression and anxiety disorders (e.g. generalised anxiety disorder [GAD], social anxiety disorder [SAD], and panic disorder) are often fairly fluid. Differences in treatment tend to occur in patients diagnosed with a pure anxiety disorder and those with comorbid anxiety and depression. For example, the proportion of patients with pure GAD who seek help and get treated for anxiety is much lower than those patients with GAD and comorbid depression.

It aims to improve access and engagement with treatment and services for people with schizophrenia; evaluate the role of specific psychological and psychosocial interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia; evaluate the role of specific pharmacological interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia; evaluate the role of specific service level interventions for people with schizophrenia; integrate the above to provide best-practice advice on the care of people with schizophrenia and their family and carers; and promote the implementation of best clinical practice through the development of recommendations tailored to the requirements of the NHS in England and Wales.",

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- and post-onset, in comparison to the general population.

The current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia patients.

The recent advent of atypical antipsychotics has provided new clinical options and set higher expectations for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is not yet clear how each different drug will fit within the therapeutic armamentarium and this lack is most evident with considering patients with treatment refractory schizophrenia. On the other hand, the expectation of superior efficacy, more benign side effect profile and potential to impact the longitudinal course of schizophrenia provide a rationale for the use of novel antipsychotics as a first-line treatment of schizophrenia.",

Mania is characterized by an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, along with increased energy levels, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and risky behavior. In contrast, in Bipolar II disorder, individuals experience hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes and generally last for at least four days. Hypomania is similar to mania but with milder symptoms.\n\n2. Depressive Episodes: Both Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorders involve depressive episodes. However, in Bipolar II disorder, individuals experience longer and more frequent depressive episodes compared to Bipolar I disorder. These depressive episodes are characterized by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sometimes suicidal thoughts.\n\n3. Severity of Illness: Bipolar I disorder is generally considered more severe than Bipolar II disorder due to the presence of full-blown manic episodes.

BACKGROUND: Classic and second-generation antipsychotic mood stabilizers are recommended for treatment of bipolar disorder, yet there are no randomized comparative effectiveness studies that have examined the 'real-world' advantages and disadvantages of these medications. PURPOSE: We describe the strategic decisions in the design of the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar CHOICE). This article outlines the key issues and solutions the investigators faced in designing a clinical trial that would maximize generalizability and inform real-world clinical treatment of bipolar disorder. METHODS: Bipolar CHOICE was a 6-month, multi-site, prospective, randomized clinical trial of outpatients with bipolar disorder. This study compares the",

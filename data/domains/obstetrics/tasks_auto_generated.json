BACKGROUND: Early pregnancy loss (unintended pregnancy loss before 20 completed weeks of gestation) is a common adverse pregnancy outcome, with previous evidence reporting incidence ranging from 10 to 30% of detected pregnancies. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the incidence and range of early pregnancy loss in contemporary pregnant populations based on studies with good internal and external validity. Findings may be useful for clinical counseling in pre-conception and family planning settings and for people who experience early pregnancy loss.

OBJECTIVE: To review the risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders in a subsequent pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Women with a history of preeclampsia are at an increased risk of preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. The magnitude of this risk is dependent on gestational age at the time of disease onset, severity of disease, and presence or absence of preexisting medical disorders.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the incidence and range of early pregnancy loss in contemporary pregnant populations based on studies with good internal and external validity. Findings may be useful for clinical counseling in pre-conception and family planning settings and for people who experience early pregnancy loss.

Decidua is a transient uterine tissue shared by mammals with hemochorial placenta and is essential for pregnancy. The decidua is infiltrated by many immune cells promoting pregnancy. Adult bone marrow (BM)-derived cells (BMDCs) differentiate into rare populations of nonhematopoietic endometrial cells in the uterus. However, whether adult BMDCs become nonhematopoietic decidual cells and contribute functionally to pregnancy is unknown. Here, we show that pregnancy mobilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the circulation and that pregnancy induces considerable adult BMDCs recruitment to decidua, where some differentiate into nonhematopoietic prolactin-expressing decidual cells. To explore the functional importance of nonhematopoietic BMDCs to pregnancy, we used Homeobox a11 (Hoxa11)-deficient mice, having endometrial stromal-specific defects precluding decidualization and successful",

However, limited data exists on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the majority of the medications used in pregnancy. In this article, we first describe basic concepts (drug absorption, bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and transport) in pharmacokinetics. Then, we discuss several physiological changes that occur during pregnancy that theoretically affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Further, we provide a brief review of the literature on the clinical pharmacokinetic studies performed in pregnant women in recent years. In general, pregnancy increases the clearance of several drugs and correspondingly decreases drug exposure during pregnancy.

IMPORTANCE: Preeclampsia is the most common type of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, affecting nearly 5% of pregnant women. The risk of recurrence influences the choices of parents regarding subsequent pregnancies and necessitates the counseling of obstetricians. OBJECTIVE: To review the risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders in a subsequent pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Women with a history of preeclampsia are at an increased risk of preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. The magnitude of this risk is dependent on gestational age at the time of disease onset, severity of disease, and presence or absence of preexisting medical disorders. RESULTS: For preeclamptic women with severe features in an initial pregnancy, recurrence rates for any type of preeclampsia are",

    "correct_answer": "Preeclampsia: multiple approaches for a multifactorial disease. The multifocal nature of preeclampsia is related to its pathogenesis. Although the exact pathway leading to preeclampsia continues to be poorly defined, many promising insights are discovered every year. Continued interest in this disease process, as evidenced by over 25,000 published articles on preeclampsia, has led to a variety of useful but imperfect in vitro and animal models for a disorder that is fairly restricted, albeit not exclusive, to humans. In this Clinical Puzzle article, we discuss the multiple pathological factors and processes that contribute to preeclampsia and the existing experimental models used to study them, and highlight outstanding research questions in the field.",

Preeclampsia is a disorder characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs, typically the kidneys.

These seizures are usually generalized convulsions but can also involve specific body parts.\n\nBoth preeclampsia and eclampsia can lead to serious complications for both the mother and baby. Complications for the mother may include:\n\n1. HELLP syndrome: A severe variant of preeclampsia that involves Hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count.

Many of the questions that surround these clinical issues have only a limited evidence base. This guide does not cover the general care of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy. It also does not cover screening for gestational diabetes or evidence about diet and exercise in the management of gestational diabetes.",

    "correct_answer": "Adequate Prenatal Care: An Integrative Review. INTRODUCTION: Prenatal care (PNC) is a core element of preventive care and is vital in identifying and managing conditions that can put the pregnant person and the fetus at risk. National and international guidelines differ in what is considered adequate or quality PNC. Indices of care adequacy rely only on number of attended PNC visits without regard to factors that affect a patient's ability to obtain care or the quality of the care received. This integrative review explored stakeholders' perceptions of adequate and quality PNC. METHODS: Three electronic databases, CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science, were searched to identify original research articles published between 2012 and April 2022. Studies conducted in the United States, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and having a",

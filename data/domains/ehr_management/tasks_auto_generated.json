The future electronic health record is expected to be a shared tool, engaging patients in decision making, wellness and disease management and providing data for individual decision support, population management and analytics. Many drivers will determine this path, including payment model reform, proliferation of mobile platforms, telemedicine, genomics and individualized medicine and advances in 'big data' technologies.",

BACKGROUND: An unofficial standardized \"write-up\" outline is commonly used for documenting history and physical examinations, giving oral presentations, and teaching clinical skills. Despite general acceptance, there is an apparent discrepancy between the way clinical encounters are conducted and how they are documented. METHODS: Fifteen medical school websites were randomly selected from search-engine generated lists. One example of a history and physical write-up from each of six sites, one teaching outline from each of nine additional sites, and recommendations for documentation made in two commonly used textbooks were compared for similarities and differences. RESULTS: Except for minor variations in documenting background information, all sampled materials utilized the same standardized format.

The enhanced availability of health information in an electronic format is strategic for industry-wide efforts to improve the quality and reduce the cost of health care, yet it brings a concomitant concern of greater risk for loss of privacy among health care participants. The authors review the conflicting goals of accessibility and security for electronic medical records and discuss nontechnical and technical aspects that constitute a reasonable security solution. It is argued that with guiding policy and current technology, an electronic medical record may offer better security than a traditional paper record.",

In 1997, the American Medical Informatics Association proposed a US information strategy that included a population health record (PopHR). Despite subsequent progress on the conceptualization, development, and implementation of electronic health records and personal health records, minimal progress has occurred on the PopHR. Adapting International Organization for Standarization electronic health records standards, we define the PopHR as a repository of statistics, measures, and indicators regarding the state of and influences on the health of a defined population, in computer processable form, stored and transmitted securely, and accessible by multiple authorized users. The PopHR is based upon an explicit population health framework and a standardized logical information model.

    "correct_answer": "Creation of structured documentation templates using Natural Language Processing techniques. Structured Clinical Documentation is a fundamental component of the healthcare enterprise, linking both clinical (e.g., electronic health record, clinical decision support) and administrative functions (e.g., evaluation and management coding, billing). One of the challenges in creating good quality documentation templates has been the inability to address specialized clinical disciplines and adapt to local clinical practices. A one-size-fits-all approach leads to poor adoption and inefficiencies in the documentation process. On the other hand, the cost associated with manual generation of documentation templates is significant. Consequently there is a need for at least partial automation of the template generation process. We propose an approach and methodology for the creation of structured documentation templates for diabetes using Natural Language Processing (NLP).",

    "correct_answer": "Procedure coding in the American Joint Replacement Registry. In October 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services transitioned from the 9th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes for reporting patient diagnosis and medical procedures to the 10th version (ICD-10). The multitude of coding options for total joint arthroplasty in ICD-10-procedural coding (ICD-10-PCS) poses some challenges for the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) in identifying precise procedures being reported. While AJRR participating hospitals are familiar with ICD-10-PCS, this new coding may not have been introduced to most AJRR participating surgeons. To address these issues, AJRR initiated an ICD-10 workgroup to define and map appropriate ICD-10 codes to total joint procedure types. This initiative sought to improve accuracy of AJRR data.",

METHODS: ICD-11 has now implemented an addendum chapter X called \"Extension Codes\". This chapter contains numerous codes containing information on concepts including disease stage, severity, histopathology, medicaments, and anatomical details. When linked to a stem code representing a clinical state, the extension codes add significant detail and allow for multidimensional coding. RESULTS: This paper discusses the purposes and uses of extension codes and presents three examples of how extension codes can be used in coding clinical detail. CONCLUSION: ICD-11 with its extension codes implemented has",

The ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition) is a coding system used to categorize and code various diseases, conditions, and medical procedures.\n\nTo classify the health records, you would need to review the diagnoses and treatments mentioned and assign the corresponding ICD-10 codes to them. Each diagnosis or condition will have a specific code that represents it in the coding system.\n\nFor example:\n1. If a patient's medical history mentions a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, you would assign the ICD-10 code E11 for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n2. If a patient's record includes a treatment for a broken bone, you would assign the appropriate ICD-10 code for the specific type of fracture or injury.\n\nWithout specific information about the diagnoses and treatments mentioned in the health records, I cannot provide the exact classification based on ICD-10 codes. However, this is the general process followed to classify health records using the ICD-10 coding system.",

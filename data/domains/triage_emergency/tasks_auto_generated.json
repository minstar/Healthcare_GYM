    "correct_answer": "A critical discourse analysis of provision of end-of-life care in key UK critical care documents. UNLABELLED: This article highlights certain practical and professional difficulties in providing end-of-life (EOL) care for patients in critical care units and explores discourses arising from guidelines for critical care services. BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients die in critical care after decisions to withdraw or withhold treatment. Guidelines for provision of critical care suggest, wherever possible, moving patients out of critical care at the EOL. This may not necessarily be conducive to a 'good death' for patients or their loved ones. There is a moral responsibility for both nurses and doctors to ensure that decision-making around EOL issues is sensitively implemented, that decisions about care includes families, patients when able, nurses and doctors,",

Increasing complexity and costs are a fundamental problem in critical care medicine, leading researchers to study opportunities and threats to continue to provide high-quality care in a more efficient health system. Over the past decades, we have learned from industrial methods that quality improvement and resource management can help achieve these results. Last year, Critical Care published a number of papers that highlight key points of critical care resource management. Each of these is grouped into one of three broad categories, based on domains of quality: (a) outcomes, in which we review long-term outcome data with an emphasis on the aging population, strategies to help mitigate the psychological burden of critical care, adverse events, and the appropriate use of resources, such",

Critical care settings have been shown to benefit patients who are medically unstable and suffer potentially life-threatening diseases []. In a critical care setting, patients often fail to respond to the therapy or become considerably exhausted for interventions []. Under such a circumstance, the withdrawal of treatment will inevitably be considered. The literature defines ‘withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment’ as the end of medical therapy (e.g. antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs) with a clear intent not to choose substitute treatment []. However, this concept is different from withdrawal of care. Evidently, providing care for patients and ensuring comfort is as important as aggressive treatment.

BACKGROUND: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is a potentially serious skin injury that can lead to pressure ulcers (PUs). Multiple studies have indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence and severity of IAD in two groups on a progressive care unit (PCU) using a defined skin care protocol: cleaning with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, then applying a skin protectant/barrier. The control group received the skin care protocol every 12 hours and the interventional group received the protocol every 6 hours; both groups also received it as needed.

    "correct_answer": "Does skin care frequency affect the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients? BACKGROUND: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is a potentially serious skin injury that can lead to pressure ulcers (PUs). Multiple studies have indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence and severity of IAD in two groups on a progressive care unit (PCU) using a defined skin care protocol: cleaning with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, then applying a skin protectant/barrier. The control group received the skin care protocol every 12 hours and the interventional group received the protocol every 6 hours; both groups also received it as needed. METHODS: A 9-month randomized prospective",

BACKGROUND: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the \"level of hospital\" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and/or hospital length of stay. METHODS: Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured",

MRI offers superior detail in diagnosis compared to CT scan, however, it can be more costly and take longer to scan. CT scans are often a faster option and much less expensive than MRI scans. Radiation exposure is also lower with CT scans due to the shorter scanning time. In terms of patient comfort, MRI can make some patients feel claustrophobic while CT scanning requires the patient to remain still and can be uncomfortable. In summary, MRI and CT scans are both effective medical imaging tests used in diagnosis, however each one offers different advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, radiation exposure, and patient comfort.",

OBJECTIVE: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. METHODS: From 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination. RESULTS: In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All",

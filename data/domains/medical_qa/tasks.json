    "ticket": "QUESTION: A 69-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his daughter due to confusion. She reports that her father did not remember who she was yesterday, and his refrigerator was completely empty when she tried to make him lunch. She states that he was acting like himself when she visited him last week. She also notes that he has struggled with alcoholism for many years and has not seen a doctor in over two decades. She is unsure if he has any other chronic medical conditions. In the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), pulse is 103/min, respirations are 22/min, and O2 saturation is 92% on room air. His BMI is 17.1 kg/m^2. Physical exam reveals an extremely thin and frail man who is not oriented to person, place, or time. As he is being examined, he becomes unresponsive and desaturates to 84%. He is intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit for what is found to be pneumonia, and the patient is started on total parental nutrition as he is sedated and has a history of aspiration from a prior hospitalization. Two days later, physical exam is notable for new peripheral edema. Laboratory tests at that time reveal the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 133 mEq/L\nCl-: 101 mEq/L\nK+: 2.4 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 22 mg/dL\nGlucose: 124 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nPhosphate: 1.1 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.0 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following could have prevented the complication seen in this patient?\n\nOption A: Slow initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)\nOption B: Use of enteral nutrition\nOption C: Initiation of furosemide\nOption D: Use of low-sugar TPN",

He is of a lower socioeconomic status and has a history of alcohol and drug abuse. On physical examination his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Physical examination is remarkable for a unilateral left-sided focus of diminished vesicular respiration and rales. X-ray shows a focus of infiltration in the upper portion of the left lung that is 2 cm in diameter with signs of cavitation. A nucleic acid amplification test is positive for M. tuberculosis. The patient is prescribed an anti-tuberculosis (TB) regimen that includes rifampin. Which target will be inhibited by rifampin, and which process will be disrupted?\n\nOption A: DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, transcription\nOption B: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, translation\nOption C: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, transcription\nOption D: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, splicing",

    "ticket": "QUESTION: A 3-year-old girl is brought in by her parents to her pediatrician for concerns about their child’s behavior. Since the parents started taking their child to daycare, they have become concerned that their daughter has not been behaving like other children her age. Most notably, she seldom responds when her name is called at home or at daycare. Additionally, she has been getting in trouble with the day care staff for not following directions but instead demanding to play with the train set at all times. She has been asked numerous times to share the toys, but the patient does not play with the other children. The parents state that the patient was born vaginally following a normal pregnancy, and the patient had been meeting developmental milestones all along. While she does not speak much, she is able to construct sentences up to 4-5 words. On exam, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 106/60 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 14/min. The patient does not cooperate with gross or fine motor testing, but she appears to have no trouble running around the room and draws very detailed trains with crayons. While drawing and standing, she frequently makes flapping motions with her hands. The patient has ample vocabulary, but speaks in a singsong voice mostly to herself and does not engage during the exam.

    "raw_question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought in by her parents to her pediatrician for concerns about their child’s behavior. Since the parents started taking their child to daycare, they have become concerned that their daughter has not been behaving like other children her age. Most notably, she seldom responds when her name is called at home or at daycare. Additionally, she has been getting in trouble with the day care staff for not following directions but instead demanding to play with the train set at all times. She has been asked numerous times to share the toys, but the patient does not play with the other children. The parents state that the patient was born vaginally following a normal pregnancy, and the patient had been meeting developmental milestones all along. While she does not speak much, she is able to construct sentences up to 4-5 words. On exam, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 106/60 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 14/min.

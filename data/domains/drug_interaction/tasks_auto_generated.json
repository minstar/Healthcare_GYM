    "correct_answer": "Cervical radiculopathy is a condition affecting the nervous system that occurs when a nerve root in the spine is compressed due to a cervical spine pathology, such as a herniated or bulging disc, osteoarthritis, or spondylosis. This compression causes pain in the neck, shoulder, or arm, and may include other neurological issues, including paresthesia, muscle weakness, and impaired reflexes. The onset of symptoms can be sudden or gradual, depending on the cause of the compression. Diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy is based on clinical presentation, and imaging with MRI is the preferred test to identify the underlying cause. Treatment typically involves pain management, physiotherapy and referral to an orthopedic or neurosurgeon to address the root cause of the issue.",

Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.",

    "ticket": "Is trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) progressive and how is it diagnosed?",
    "correct_answer": "Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Individuals with trisomy 13 often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia), extra fingers or toes, an opening in the lip (a cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Due to the presence of several life-threatening medical problems, many infants with trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year. Trisomy 13 is not progressive; instead, it is a congenital condition that is present from birth.Diagnosis of trisomy 13 is usually made based on clinical examination at birth due to the presence of numerous physical abnormalities. In addition, prenatal screening can detect the presence of trisomy 13, including noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). High-resolution ultrasound is also used during pregnancy to detect physical characteristics symptomatic of trisomy 13. For a definitive diagnosis, a karyotype - a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes - is done, which can identify the third copy of chromosome 13 that causes trisomy 13.",

    "correct_answer": "Keratosis Pilaris is a common skin condition that results in small, hard bumps caused by dead skin cells and keratin buildup. While Keratosis Pilaris cannot be cured, various treatments can help to manage the symptoms and improve the skin's appearance.Firstly, regular exfoliation can help to remove the buildup of dead skin cells. This can be done using either a physical exfoliant such as a scrub or a chemical exfoliant containing ingredients like alpha or beta hydroxy acids.Moisturising regularly is another integral part of the treatment. Creams or lotions with lactic acid, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or urea can help to exfoliate and moisturize the skin.Additionally, retinoids may be recommended by your dermatologist. These can help to promote cell turnover and prevent the plugging of hair follicles.In some cases, laser therapy may also be considered, though this is usually reserved for more severe cases as it can cause side effects and the results are not permanent. Importantly, it's recommended to avoid skin irritations and to protect the skin from the sun, as both can worsen the condition.However, it's worth mentioning that results can vary from person to person and what works best can depend on individual skin types and the severity of the condition. Consulting with a healthcare professional or a dermatologist is advised to determine the most suitable treatment.",

In some cases, like with sinusitis (which often presents with pressure in cheeks and eyes), doctors opt for steroids to reduce inflammation of the sinus tissues and thus relieve the associated symptoms.However, the use of steroids should be guided by a doctor's prescription, as they come with potential side effects that need to be monitored, especially with prolonged use. It's worth noting that while steroids might alleviate your symptoms, they are not a cure-all and don't address the underlying source of the pressure.

This can lead to unexpected side effects, reduced effectiveness, or increased toxicity of the drugs involved.\n\n2. How can drug-drug interactions occur?\n\nDrug-drug interactions can occur through several mechanisms:\n- Pharmacokinetic interactions: When one drug affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of another drug.\n- Pharmacodynamic interactions: When two drugs with similar or opposing actions interact at their target sites, leading to enhanced or diminished effects.\n- Combined adverse effects: When multiple drugs have individual side effects that can worsen when used together.\n\n3. Give an example of a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction.\n\nOne example of a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction is the combination of Warfarin (blood thinner) and Metronidazole (an antibiotic). Metronidazole inhibits the enzyme responsible for metabolizing Warfarin, resulting in increased levels of Warfarin in the blood. This can lead to an increased risk of bleeding.\n\n4.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to drug–drug interactions (from here on referred to as drug interactions) constitute an important cause of drug-related problems globally]. Despite modern capability and increased regulatory expectations to investigate potential drug interactions during drug development, interactions between marketed drugs may still be unknown or insufficiently characterized. This not only applies to new drugs entering the market but also to older drugs used in new combinations and to drugs used in new patient populations. Clinical trials are typically not powered to detect drug interactions apart from such that are expected based on prior preclinical and pharmacokinetic studies. Exclusion criteria regarding concurrent medications further reduce their capacity for real-world clinical drug interaction detection. Hence, some",

    "correct_answer": "Drug-drug interactions occur when two or more drugs interact with each other in a way that affects their effectiveness or safety. These interactions can either amplify or decrease the effects of the drugs involved, leading to adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic benefit.\n\nDrug interactions can occur through several mechanisms:\n\n1. Pharmacokinetic Interactions: These interactions affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of drugs in the body. For example, one drug may inhibit the enzymes responsible for metabolizing another drug, leading to increased levels and potential toxicity. Alternatively, some drugs can enhance the excretion of other drugs, reducing their effectiveness.\n\n2. Pharmacodynamic Interactions: These interactions occur when two drugs with similar or opposing effects are taken together. One drug may enhance or suppress the actions of another by directly interacting with the same receptors or pathways in the body.\n\n3. Combined Toxicity: Some drugs have their own inherent toxicities. When taken together, these toxicities can be additive or synergistic, leading to an increased risk of side effects or adverse reactions.\n\n4. Drug-Food Interactions: Certain foods, beverages, or dietary supplements can interact with drugs and alter their absorption, metabolism, or action. Grapefruit juice is a well-known example that inhibits certain liver enzymes responsible for drug metabolism, leading to increased drug levels in the body.\n\n5.

Drug-drug interactions can be classified in terms of indirect effects by one drug on gastrointestinal tract physiology influencing the absorption of other drugs, or direct interactions involving altered pH, adsorption, absorption, or chelation. Most, but not all, drug-drug interactions result in reduced or delayed systemic drug availability. Drug-food interactions may result in reduced, delayed, or increased systemic drug availability. The absorption of only a small number of drugs is unaffected by concomitant food intake. The degree of interaction and whether it positively or negatively affects drug absorption depends on a number of factors including the physical and chemical nature of the drug, the formulation, the type of meal,",
